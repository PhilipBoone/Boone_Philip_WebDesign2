    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p>The Westside Music Foundation will promote musical culture and appreciation by providing high-quality musical concerts and activities to the public, featuring professional artists and leading educators, free of charge, by voluntary donation, or for a nominal fee to cover costs.

    The Westside Music Foundation will also work to provide educational opportunities to the public, with a particular emphasis on youth programs, to promote the importance of music, and to help others develop appreciation, understanding, skill, and proficiency in music through music education.
        
    Our goal is to provide high-quality musical education opportunities, particularly to youth who otherwise do not have access to top-caliber teachers and musicians as mentors due to financial means or lack of exposure due to socio-economic background. </p>
